# 50-Lines

Fifty Lines is an art project by Kevin McVey.  
Its development is still a work in progress. A current iteration may be explored [here](http://kevin.4mcveys.com/50/lines.html).

Though the piece is run in one's browser, its intended installation location is on a Raspberry Pi. There are thus two versions of this code:

---

### Raspberry Pi
(update me!)

### Web
